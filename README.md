**Foody App**

Learned from Jonas Schmedtmann's Complete Javascript Course.

This is an app that used ES6 and Asynchronous Javascript to fetch data from an API to display food recipes.

It used Webpack to bundle the Javascript modules and Babel to convert ES6 code back to ES5.

Future scope for this project is to use a better API as some foods donâ€™t return any recipes.
